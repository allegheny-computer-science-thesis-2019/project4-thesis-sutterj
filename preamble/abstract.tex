\chapter*{Abstract} 

This project set out to create a tool that would allow a user, with any level of musical or computer science knowledge, to compose a melody.  The tool contains a learning and feedback system as part of a user interface to guide the user through the composition process.  This document details the background, history, design, creation, testing, and results of this tool.  The history and background are provided through existing AI powered composers.  The design and creation of this tool is discussed in detail with source code examples and explanations.  The testing and results of this project were generated through a user experience study around the reactions to the tool and its user interface.
