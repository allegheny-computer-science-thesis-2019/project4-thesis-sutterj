\chapter{Discussion and Future Work}  
\label{ch:discussionandfuturework}

The computer composer that was designed, implemented, and tested as part of this project is very different that the other composers that currently exist.  While their focus is on the composition algorithm and ability of the computer system itself, this tool attempted to bring the basic functions of a computer composition system to all kinds of users through the creation of a user interface with built in feedback mechanisms.

While this particular tool does not feature an advanced AI powered composition, it does contain an a user interface designed to be accessible for all users.  This cannot be found on any of the other computer composers that are available.  It is in this way that this tool sets itself apart.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

There is most certainly some merit to the idea of designing a tool around the idea of accessibility.  A person might build the most advanced tool ever created, but if it never reaches the hands of the average person, can it really have the same impact?  While it is the case that not every technology is meant to shared with everyone, technologies that are used to create and make art should be available to everyone.

Many pieces of software within the music industry are priced in such a way that they are available only to the elite and industry professionals.  This limits the possible creative output of these tools all for the sake of profit.  By making these tools accessible to more people, the potential output from these tools would be dramatically increased.

This would lead to more music and more diverse music being developed and created.  And while this tool is not a full fledged notation program, it exists to bring music composition to people from all sorts of educational backgrounds and levels of experience.

\section{Summary of Results}
\label{sec:summaryofresults}

This section details the successes and failures of each of the major areas of the project.  This includes the development and functions of the composer, the design and deployment of the user interface, and the results and effectiveness of the user experience study.

\subsection{Composer Development}
\label{subsec:summaryofresultscomposerdevelopment}

Overall, the functions that were implemented within the composer are successful and perform their desired functions.  Initially, the composer was meant to have more functionalities related to harmonization and writing parts for additional voices, but due to time constraints and developmental difficulties, the composer now only focuses on melody generation and revision.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

While it is certainly possible to implement a harmonization function, this is far more complex than the creation of a singular voiced melody.  There are many variables involved in harmonization and lots of room for user decisions and choices.  This makes development of this sort of function more challenging and makes the system of recommendations to the user much more complex.  The system is then much more difficult to use and there was simply not enough time to resolve all of theses issues.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

However, the melody generation system is very robust and contains all of the functions that it needs in order to be able to help the user generate a melody.  It may be much simpler without the harmonization system, but overall this helps the tool to better reach the overall goal of the project by making this something that anyone can use and understand.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

This section discusses the possible extensions and revisions that could be performed on the system.  Some of these extensions were elements that were originally meant to be included in the system, but were eliminated for various reasons.  It is quite possible, however, to include them with more time and resources.

\subsection{Composer Extension}
\label{subsec:composerextension}

The most significant extensions to the composer would be the addition of functions for harmonization, additional voices, and supporting tracks.

\subsubsection{Harmonization}
\label{subsubsec:harmonization}

The idea behind this function is to generate a chord progression and then voice these chords based on the notes in the melody.  This would need to take into account voice leading and the movement between the melody and the bass note.  Adding this function would allow the user to create full fledged songs rather than just melodies.

\subsubsection{Additional Voices}
\label{subsubsec:additionalvoices}

This functions would use the chord progression generated by the harmonization function to write a complementary line to the melody.  It would add another layer to the composition and create musical interest with possible dissonance and resolution.

\subsubsection{Supporting Tracks}
\label{subsubsec:supportingtracks}

The function to create supporting tracks would generate some sort of percussion and/or bass instrument accompaniment to give the composition a more finalized sound.  This adds yet another layer of musical interest and provides a metronomic backing to the playback.
